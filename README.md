How to deploy:

After cloning, create empty files named "YelpClientID", "YelpClientSecret", and "GoogleAPIKey".

Inside file "YelpClientID", place the client ID that you received from Yelp.

Inside file "YelpClientSecret", place the client secret that you received from Yelp.

Inside file "GoogleAPIKey", place the Google Maps API key that you received from Google.

Finally, run:
